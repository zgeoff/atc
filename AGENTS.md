# Agent Guidelines

## Operations

- AGENTS.md is generated from `agents/shared.md` and `agents/project.md` — edit the partials, never
  AGENTS.md itself. The shared partial is synced from
  [zgeoff/tools](https://github.com/zgeoff/tools); cross-project rule changes belong there.
- Perform all work on a branch in a git worktree under `.worktrees/` (e.g.
  `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>`) — never commit directly on `main`.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages.
- Commit subjects and PR titles use the imperative mood ("add X", never "added X" or a bare noun
  phrase) — a squash merge makes the PR title the commit subject.
- Open PRs against `main` using the PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`). Descriptions
  are condensed: lead paragraph ≤2 sentences, one-line bullets, ≤150 words — write the short version
  first, don't draft long and trim.
- After pushing, link the PR URL in your response.
- A PR is ready only when its checks are green: watch CI (`gh pr checks <n> --watch`) after opening
  or updating, and report a failure with what you're doing about it.

## Code style

Mechanically enforced rules (oxfmt, oxlint, format-codemod) aren't repeated here — this file covers
what tooling can't check.

- One primary export per file, and the file name kebab-cases that export (`with-jest-context.ts`
  exports `withJestContext`). Exceptions: `index.ts` entrypoints, `types.ts` for a package's shared
  types, and side-effect-only modules, which are named for what they do (`augment-bun-test.ts`).
- Module order: imports, the primary export, then private helpers in composition order (depth-first)
  — never helpers first. Supporting declarations (consts, interfaces, type aliases) sit directly
  above their first use, never below it and never leading the file; types for the primary export's
  signature may sit just above it.
- Acronyms stay uppercase in identifiers (`runCLI`, `parseCLIArgs`, `ASTNode`, `pkgURL`,
  `isPackageJSON`) — except when one starts a camelCase name, where it lowercases whole (`cliPath`,
  `astNode`). ID counts as an acronym: `userID`, `sessionID` — never `userId` — and `idToken` when
  it starts a name. File names are unaffected: kebab-case lowercases everything (`parse-cli-args.ts`
  exports `parseCLIArgs`).

### Function naming

Every function name starts with a prefix from the closed list below: pick from it, or extend this
file in the same PR that introduces the new verb. The prefix is a contract — a reader should know
the function's shape without opening it.

**Predicates** — return boolean, no side effects:

| Prefix   | Contract                | Example          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `is`     | type or state test      | `isVarDecl`      |
| `has`    | containment, possession | `hasBlankLine`   |
| `can`    | capability              | `canResize`      |
| `should` | policy decision         | `shouldSkipFile` |
| `needs`  | requirement             | `needsBlankLine` |

**Pure producers** — result comes from arguments alone, no side effects:

| Prefix                        | Contract                                                                  | Example             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `build<Result>[From<Source>]` | default constructor for values; drop `From<Source>` when no single source | `buildEditsFromAST` |
| `define<X>`                   | identity; its only job is compile-time constraint of its literal argument | `defineErrors`      |
| `parse`                       | unstructured input → structure, invalid input reported                    | `parseSource`       |
| `encode`                      | structure → its defined compact or wire form, reversed by `decode`        | `encodeState`       |
| `decode`                      | `encode`'s output → the original structure, malformed input reported      | `decodeState`       |

| `pick`                        | select among known alternatives                                           | `pickMode`          |
| `find`                        | search that can miss — null/undefined on miss                             | `findPrevious`      |
| `get`                         | cheap access that cannot miss (throwing on a broken invariant is fine)    | `getNodeEnd`        |
| `collect`                     | gather from a traversal or scan                                           | `collectChildNodes` |
| `count`                       | how many                                                                  | `countNewlines`     |
| `split`                       | one value → parts                                                         | `splitLines`        |
| `merge`                       | parts → one value                                                         | `mergeWindows`      |
| `sort`                        | reorder                                                                   | `sortEdits`         |
| `format`                      | value → human-readable string                                             | `formatRange`       |
| `render`                      | structure → output text or markup                                         | `renderHunk`        |
| `normalize`                   | variant forms → the canonical form                                        | `normalizePath`     |
| `resolve`                     | follow indirection to a concrete value                                    | `resolveBinPath`    |
| `expand`                      | compact form → full form                                                  | `expandInputs`      |
| `compress`                    | value → its reversible compact encoding                                   | `compressGraph`     |
| `decompress`                  | reverse a `compress` encoding (non-encoded shorthand is `expand`)         | `decompressGraph`   |
| `to<Result>`                  | cheap representation change                                               | `toPosixPath`       |
| `transform`                   | a package's own source→source operation                                   | `transform`         |

**Effectful** — touches the world (filesystem, streams, processes, registries):

| `verify`       | test a claim or credential against evidence, rejecting on mismatch                                                                      | `verifySession`    |

| `send`         | transmit a payload to a remote receiver (fire-and-forget or RPC — no resource semantics; REST mutations are `create`/`update`/`remove`) | `sendWebhook`      |
| `wait`         | block until an event or condition resolves; may return the awaited value                                                                | `waitForMessage`   |
| `setup`        | prepare the environment or fixture the following code assumes; `teardown` reverses it                                                   | `setupTest`        |
| `teardown`     | release what `setup` prepared                                                                                                           | `teardownTest`     |
| `start`        | put a long-running resource into service (server, worker, poll loop); `stop` reverses it                                                | `startQueues`      |
| `stop`         | take a long-running resource out of service, releasing what `start` acquired                                                            | `stopWorker`       |
| `drain`        | consume a pending backlog until empty                                                                                                   | `drainJobs`        |

**Wrappers and factories** — the result is behaviour, not data:

| Prefix    | Contract                                  | Example           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `with<X>` | HOF that runs a callback inside a context | `withJestContext` |
| `make<X>` | factory whose result is itself a function | `makeExcluder`    |

**Framework conventions** — where the ecosystem's prefix is load-bearing, it wins:

| Prefix                   | Contract                                                                                                                | Example          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `use<X>`                 | React hook — the prefix drives rules-of-hooks linting; helpers inside a hook follow the normal taxonomy                 | `useDebounce`    |
| `on<Event>`              | event-callback prop or parameter                                                                                        | `onRowClick`     |
| `handle<Event>`          | local implementation passed to an `on<Event>` prop — the idiomatic React pair; the `handle` ban applies everywhere else | `handleRowClick` |
| `handle<LifecycleEvent>` | implementation of an engine lifecycle callback, keyed by the engine's lifecycle-event enum                              | `handleTick`     |

**Banned** — each is a vaguer or synonymous form of a listed verb; use that one instead: `handle`
(except the `handle<Event>` framework conventions), `process`, `manage`, `do`, `perform` (say what
it does), `execute` (→ `run`), `compute` (→ `build`), `fetch` (→ `read`), `save`/`store` (→
`write`), `delete` (→ `remove`), `search`/`lookup` (→ `find`/`get`).

Algorithm-native vocabulary (`walk`, `backtrack`, `slideDiagonal`) is allowed inside the module
implementing that algorithm — forcing list verbs onto textbook terms hides the algorithm.

## Dependencies

- Pin exact versions — no `^`/`~` ranges. (`bun add` saves exact automatically via `exact = true` in
  bunfig.toml — the rule applies to hand-written edits.)

# atc

atc is a terminal control tower for Claude Code sessions: a daemon (`atc daemon`) hosts stock
`claude` instances in PTYs, and thin TUI clients drive them over an NDJSON protocol behind a
keyboard-driven session list with hook-driven attention routing. No panes, no tiling, no mouse. See
`docs/architecture/overview.md` for how the pieces fit; the README documents keys and user-facing
behavior.

## Layout

Single package, no workspaces. `src/` holds the app (one primary export or entry concern per file),
`test/` holds the PTY-driven e2e suite, `bin/atc` is the executable shim. `scripts/` holds repo
tooling, not app code.

## Runtime rules

- Bun only. `bun test`, never vitest or jest. `bun <file>`, never node or ts-node.
- PTYs come from `bun-pty`. Never add `node-pty`: its fd-socket plumbing delivers no data events
  under Bun.
- The TUI is hand-rolled ANSI on purpose — no TUI framework until the daemon/screen-model
  architecture lands. Escape sequences are written as `\u001B` escapes, never raw bytes and never
  `\x1b`.
- Everything the hooks and CI run is a root `package.json` script; invoke gates by script name,
  never by re-spelling the underlying command.

## Claude integration contract

- Wrangled sessions are instrumented only via the generated `--settings` file (`writeHookSettings`):
  hooks (`SessionStart`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SessionEnd`) and a chained
  statusline. Never touch the user's own Claude settings.
- Hook and statusline reporters run inside the wrangled session and must always exit 0 — a broken
  reporter must never break the session it reports on.
- Claude is the naming authority for sessions: `/rename` custom-titles beat user-typed names beat
  auto-summaries.
- State lives in `~/.local/state/atc/`: `atc.db` (SQLite — fleet, hook-event trail, spawn history)
  plus `status.json`, which stays a plain file because statusline reporters read it without speaking
  the protocol. The fleet is rewritten on deliberate kills only, so crashes leave a restorable
  fleet.

## Function naming — project verbs

Project additions to the shared taxonomy (keep in sync with `zgeoff/function-verb` in
`.oxlintrc.json`): `ack`, `adopt`, `answer`, `attach`, `boot`, `copy`, `detach`, `draw`, `jiggle`,
`kill`, `log`, `open`, `quit`, `record`, `refresh`, `restart`, `restore`, `schedule`, `spawn`,
`truncate`, `yank`.

Exempt names (tiny geometry/row helpers and script entrypoints): `cols`, `rows`, `ptyRows`, `out`,
`main`, `boxTop`, `boxDivider`, `boxBottom`, `boxRow`, `dimRow`.

## Comments

- JSDoc is always multi-line, never single-line `/** … */`.
- No history or project state in comments — a comment describes the code as it is, never how it got
  that way or what is planned.
- Comments never name other declarations: renames strand the reference. Describe the behavior
  instead.

## Writing

- All committed prose follows the `docs-writing` skill; run its `check-prose.sh` over touched docs
  before committing.
- Banned words in all prose (fix on sight): `bites`, `CAS`, `ceiling`, `fence`/`fencing`, `floor`,
  `load-bearing`, `seam`, `surface`. One carve-out: `Surface` is the domain term for a session's
  output producer (`PtySurface`, `SdkSurface`) — that sense is legal; the vague filler sense ("API
  surface", "surfaces an error") stays banned.

## Testing

Testing conventions live in the `testing` skill (`.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`) — regimes,
harness patterns, assertion discipline. Two rules worth restating here: never spawn the real
`claude` binary in tests (verification against real Claude Code happens manually before merging
changes to the integration contract), and every gate is invoked as a root package script.

## Dependencies

- Exact pins only (bunfig `exact = true`); the 7-day `minimumReleaseAge` gate applies. When the
  latest version is younger than the gate, pin the newest version that passes — don't add exclusions
  for convenience.
- A dependency knip can't see gets its `knip.json` ignore entry in the same PR that introduces it,
  with the reason in the PR description.
